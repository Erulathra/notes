# Nice blogs
I found them nice and useful.

## Unreal Engine
* [Ari's blog](https://ari.games/) - A Unreal Engine Guru. He works at Epic so he
    know what is going on.
* [Gamedev's Eye (Okiem Deva)](https://www.youtube.com/@OkiemDeva) - Another person
    with extra ordinary knowledge and experience.

## Vulkan Rendering
* [Vulkan Guide](https://vkguide.dev/) - Best place to start Vulkan journey.
* [Learn Vulkan](https://cpp-gamedev.github.io/learn-vulkan/index.html) - I prefer Vulkan Guide, but here you can learn about nice C++ Vulkan bindings aka `vulkan.hpp`
* [The Danger Zone aka Theme Hermit's blog](https://therealmjp.github.io/) - Graphics, engine, and game programming. And maybe a few other things. 
* [Sascha Willems's blog](https://www.saschawillems.de/) - The best Vulkan examples. 
* [Yet another blog explaining Vulkan synchronization](https://themaister.net/blog/2019/08/14/yet-another-blog-explaining-vulkan-synchronization/)

## Slang
* [Slang Vulkan example](https://www.saschawillems.de/blog/2025/06/03/shaders-for-vulkan-samples-now-also-available-in-slang/)

## Engine Development
* [DeltaTime is a frame behind](https://theorangeduck.com/page/delta-time-frame-behind)
